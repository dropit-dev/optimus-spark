# Optimus Spark  
*Transform your data pipelines with the power of the AllSpark.*

**Optimus Spark** is here to roll out pre-built, battle-tested transformation templates for Apache Spark. No need to wage war against messy datasets and inefficient pipelines—Optimus Spark has your back. It's faster than Bumblebee and more powerful than Megatron (at least when it comes to data transformations).

---

## 🚀 Why Choose Optimus Spark?
- **Plug-and-Play Templates**: Skip the heavy lifting and let Optimus Spark do the transforming.  
- **Highly Customizable**: Because every dataset deserves a personal touch.  
- **Supercharged Performance**: Built to handle big data, whether it's a skirmish or a full-scale war.  
- **Detailed Documentation**: So easy, even a Decepticon could use it.  
- **Community-Driven**: Got a better idea? Join the Autobots and contribute.

## 🔧 Installation
Step 1: Summon Optimus Spark by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dropit-dev/optimus-spark.git
```

Step 2: Install dependencies (because even Autobots need fuel):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 How to Use
### Example: Roll Out a Transformation
```python
from optimus_spark.templates import example_transformation

# Load your Spark session
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Optimus Spark Example") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Load a sample dataset
data = [("Sam", 23), ("Mikaela", 28), ("Bumblebee", 7)]
columns = ["Name", "Age"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Apply the transformation
transformed_df = example_transformation(df)

# Show the results
transformed_df.show()
```

It’s like calling Optimus Prime—except instead of saving the universe, you’re saving your data pipeline. For more examples, check the [examples](examples/) directory.

## 📦 What's Inside?
- **Data Cleansing Templates**: Wipe out duplicates, nulls, and other Decepticon data elements.  
- **Schema Transformers**: Morph your data structures faster than Optimus morphs into a truck.  
- **Aggregations**: Group, sum, and dominate.  
- **Data Enrichment**: Like adding jetpacks to Bumblebee.  

Peek inside the [templates](templates/) directory for the full arsenal.
